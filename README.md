JUPITER - A ROS2 4-WHEELED ROBOT USING EPS32 | BNO055 IMU | LD-LIDAR | USB CAM
This robot is able to navigate around autonoumsly using the ROS-2 Nav2 system after a map is generated via SLAM
Moreso, the robot is able to use speech recognition to receive voice commands to initiate motion as well as have
a conversation via its text-to-speech module.  
The robot is linked to GPT-4 from openAI so that it can make use of a large-language model (LLM) to enhance its AI
Also built into the software is a memory system that allows the AI to recognise the person interacting with it and
then recall past conversations it had with the user.  New "unknown" users can introduce themselves to the robot and
the robot will face recognise them on future interactions with full recollection of past interactions.
